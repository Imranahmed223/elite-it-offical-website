                Wireless networking technology, such as Wi-Fi, has
                revolutionised the way we connect and access the internet. With
                just a wireless router, we can easily connect our devices, such
                as computers and smartphones to the internet. This technology is
                useful for various purposes, including data transmission and
                wireless communication.Â

              A network monitoring system is a tool that helps ensure the smooth
              operation of an organisation's IT and network infrastructure. It
              includes features such as high availability components to
              automatically fix hardware or software failures, a visual
              dashboard for an at-a-glance status of monitored components, and
              notifications to alert administrators of any issues. These tools
              can also initiate failover to temporarily remove problematic
              devices or circuits from service until they can be fixed. Network
              monitoring helps reduce downtime, improve security, and enhance
              customer experience, while also providing root cause analysis
              tools and clear visualisations and reports. Network monitoring at
              Elite IT Team can provide real-time information to help
              administrators optimise network efficiency and identify any
              deficiencies.
